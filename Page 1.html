        <h1>The ape caves is a famous cave system formed 1000's of years ago from a flow of lava coming off of Mount St. Helens</h1>

    <body>"The ape caves length is measured at 2.8 miles according to the WTA (Washington Trail Association)" Although I have been to this cave many times as a child, it is definitely not for everyone. This cave does have some dangers like sharp rocks, slippery ground, wet walls, and even some parts that you have to climb. </body>
<h2>This cave is especially terrible for someone who is scared of the dark. So bring some flashlights and extra batteries just in case!</h2>
<body>
    There have been moments where people drop that flashlights through the cracks of the rocks and forgot to bring another. Or even worse, they brought two dead flashights with nothing to power them. Better safe than sorry and plan for the worst.
